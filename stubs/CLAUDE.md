# Copy-Point Development Guide

This file provides guidance for working with copy-points in the CopyKit project.

## What Are Copy-Points?

Copy-points are reusable component and utility collections that can be selectively added to projects. Each copy-point is a self-contained directory with its own documentation, metadata, and implementation files.

## Copy-Point Organization

The `stubs/` directory contains all copy-points:

- **`_base/`** - Core foundation components (required by most copy-points)
- **Component copy-points** - Self-contained UI components (e.g., `accordion/`)
- **Utility copy-points** - Single-purpose utilities (e.g., `elevate/`, `shadow/`)

## Standard Copy-Point Structure

Every copy-point follows this consistent structure:

```
stubs/[name]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                        # User documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ copy-point.json                  # CLI metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                         # TypeScript files (optional)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/                    # Business logic and component behavior
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [name].ts               # Main service implementation
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [name].test.ts          # Unit tests
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [name].accessibility.test.ts # Accessibility tests
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utilities/                   # Helper functions and utilities
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [utility].ts            # Utility implementation
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [utility].test.ts       # Utility tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/                          # CSS organized in layers
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01_defaults/                 # Variables, resets, typography
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02_components/               # Reusable UI components
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03_utilities/                # Single-purpose utility classes
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 04_layouts/                  # Page-level structural styles
```

### Special Notes:
- Only `_base/` has an `index.css` master import file
- Other copy-points import specific CSS files as needed
- Not all copy-points require JavaScript (some are CSS-only)
- Layer directories are created even if empty to maintain consistency

## README.md Purpose

Each copy-point's `README.md` serves as **user documentation** for developers who want to use the copy-point in their projects.

**Required Content:**
- **Overview** - Purpose and features of the copy-point
- **Live Example** - Direct link to GitHub Pages demo (if example page exists in `/pages/[copy-point-name]/`)
- **Dependencies** - Additional copy-points required beyond `_base` (omit `_base` as it's implicit)
- **Usage** - Basic usage examples and HTML structure
- **CSS Architecture** - Custom properties and component structure
- **Integration Guide** - How to import and use in projects
- **Customization** - Examples of theming and modifications
- **Browser Support** - Compatibility requirements
- **Best Practices** - Recommended usage patterns

**Audience:** End-users of the CopyKit CLI who want to understand how to use the copy-point in their projects.

## copy-point.json Purpose

The `copy-point.json` file provides structured metadata for the CopyKit CLI and development tools.

**Schema:**
```json
{
  "name": "copy-point-name",
  "title": "Human-readable Title",
  "description": "Detailed description of features and purpose",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "features": [
    "List of key features",
    "What this copy point provides",
    "Technical capabilities"
  ],
  "dependencies": [],  // Only list additional copy-points beyond _base
  "author": "CopyKit",
  "keywords": ["relevant", "search", "terms"]
}
```

**CLI Integration:**
- `copykit list` - Shows name, title, and description
- `copykit info <name>` - Shows complete metadata
- Automatic discovery and loading by CLI tools
- Graceful fallback when metadata files are missing

## CSS Layer Organization

Copy-points use a 4-layer CSS architecture:

### 1. Defaults (`01_defaults/`)
- Browser resets and normalizations
- CSS custom properties and variables
- Typography base styles
- Global configuration

### 2. Components (`02_components/`)
- Reusable UI components
- Self-contained component styles
- Component variants and states
- Interactive element styling

### 3. Utilities (`03_utilities/`)
- Single-purpose utility classes
- Spacing, layout, and positioning
- Text and color utilities
- Responsive helpers

### 4. Layouts (`04_layouts/`)
- Page-level structural styles
- Grid and flexbox layouts
- Container and wrapper styles
- Layout-specific component arrangements

## Copy-Point Creation

### IMPORTANT: Always Use the Automated Script
**Never create copy-points manually.** Always use the automated script to ensure consistency and proper structure.

```bash
# REQUIRED: Use this script for all new copy-points
pnpm run create-copy-point [name]

# Examples:
pnpm run create-copy-point advanced
pnpm run create-copy-point components-extended
pnpm run create-copy-point dark-theme
pnpm run create-copy-point animations
```

### Script Features and Validation
The script (`scripts/create-copy-point.js`) automatically:

- **Validates naming**: Ensures kebab-case, no underscores (except `_base`), lowercase only
- **Prevents conflicts**: Checks if copy-point already exists
- **Creates structure**: Standard directories (`scripts/`, `styles/` with all 4 layers)
- **Generates templates**: Starter files with proper JSDoc comments and layer organization
- **Provides guidance**: Shows next steps and commit message format

### Copy-Point Naming Rules
- **Lowercase only**: `advanced`, `dark-theme`, `components-extended`
- **Kebab-case**: Use hyphens for multi-word names
- **No underscores**: Only `_base` uses underscore prefix
- **Descriptive**: Name should indicate purpose (`animations`, `advanced`, `dark-theme`)

### Post-Script Workflow
1. **Script generates**: Complete structure in `stubs/[name]/` including metadata and README.md templates
2. **Complete metadata**: Update `copy-point.json` with accurate title, description, features, and keywords
3. **Complete documentation**: Fill out the generated README.md template with copy-point-specific information
4. **Update commitlint**: Add `stub:[name]` scope to `.commitlintrc.cjs`
5. **Develop components**: Replace template files with actual components
6. **Test integration**: Ensure compatibility with `_base` and other copy-points
7. **Create examples**: Add demonstration pages in `pages/`
8. **Commit changes**: Use `feat(stub:[name]): create [name] copy point`

## Copy-Point Development Standards

### TypeScript Files
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Include comprehensive unit tests (`.test.ts`)
- Add accessibility tests for UI components (`.accessibility.test.ts`)
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

### CSS Files
- **Always use colorset variables** instead of direct color values for consistency and theme switching
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Include JSDoc documentation for user-facing components
- Follow the 4-layer architecture
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Colorset Usage Requirements
When developing copy-points, always use the colorset system for colors:

**‚úÖ Required - Use colorset variables:**
```css
.component {
  color: var(--font-color);
  background-color: var(--bg-color);
  border: 1px solid var(--border-color);
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgb(var(--shadow-color) / var(--shadow-alpha));
}

.component.accent {
  color: var(--accent-font-color);
  background-color: var(--accent-bg-color);
}

.component:hover {
  color: var(--accent-hover-font-color);
  background-color: var(--accent-hover-bg-color);
}
```

**‚ùå Forbidden - Direct color values:**
```css
.component {
  color: #000000;
  background-color: #ffffff;
  border: 1px solid #cccccc;
}
```

**Colorset Benefits for Copy-Points:**
- Automatic theme compatibility across all copy-points
- Consistent visual identity when mixing copy-points
- Easy customization by overriding colorset variables
- Future-proof for light/dark mode implementations

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all public APIs
- Accessibility tests for UI components
- Integration tests with `_base` dependencies
- Cross-browser compatibility validation

### Documentation Standards
- Complete README.md with usage examples
- **Live Example Links** - Include GitHub Pages demo link if example page exists
- Accurate copy-point.json metadata
- JSDoc comments for complex CSS patterns
- Integration examples for common use cases

### Live Example Documentation Requirements

**When to Include Live Example Section:**
- Check if `/pages/[copy-point-name]/` directory exists with `index.html`
- If exists, add "Live Example" section immediately after "Overview"
- If no example page exists, omit this section entirely

**Live Example Section Format:**
```markdown
## Live Example

**[üåê View Live Example](https://gherrink.github.io/copykit/[copy-point-name].html)** - See this copy point in action with interactive demonstrations.
```

**GitHub Pages URL Structure:**
- Use flattened HTML structure: `https://gherrink.github.io/copykit/[copy-point-name].html`
- NOT directory structure: `https://gherrink.github.io/copykit/[copy-point-name]/`
- Example: `accordion` copy point ‚Üí `https://gherrink.github.io/copykit/accordion.html`

**Examples of Copy Points with Live Demos:**
- `accordion/` ‚Üí `https://gherrink.github.io/copykit/accordion.html`
- `border/` ‚Üí `https://gherrink.github.io/copykit/border.html`
- `rounded-simple/` ‚Üí `https://gherrink.github.io/copykit/rounded-simple.html`
- `shadow/` ‚Üí `https://gherrink.github.io/copykit/shadow.html`

## Copy-Point Dependencies

### Base Dependency (_base)
**IMPORTANT**: Do not list `_base` as a dependency in README.md or copy-point.json files.

`_base` is an implicit foundation dependency that provides:
- CSS reset and normalization
- Core utility classes
- Base component styles
- JavaScript utilities (DOM, events, etc.)

### Inter-Copy-Point Dependencies
- **Only list additional copy-points** beyond `_base` in `copy-point.json`
- **Only document non-base dependencies** in README.md
- Ensure compatibility with existing copy-points
- Test integration scenarios
- Provide fallback behavior when dependencies are missing

### Dependency Documentation Rules
- `dependencies: []` - For copy-points that only need `_base`
- `dependencies: ["other-copy-point"]` - For copy-points that need additional ones
- Never include `"_base"` in the dependencies array
- In README.md, only mention additional dependencies beyond `_base`

## Conventional Commits for Copy-Points

Use these commit message formats:

```bash
# Creating new copy-points
git commit -m "feat(stub:[name]): create [name] copy point"

# Working on copy-points
git commit -m "feat(stub:[name]): add enhanced button variants"
git commit -m "fix(stub:[name]): resolve transition timing issue"
git commit -m "style(stub:[name]): format CSS utility classes"
```

**Important**: After creating a new copy-point, you must manually add its scope to `.commitlintrc.cjs` in the `scope-enum` array.
