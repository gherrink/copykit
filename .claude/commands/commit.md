# Commit Changes

Create a git commit following the project's conventional commit standards defined in CLAUDE.md.

## Process:
1. **Run tests**: Execute `pnpm test` to ensure all functionality works (required by project standards)
2. **Run linting**: Execute `pnpm run lint` to ensure code quality (required by project standards)
3. **Check git status**: Review staged and unstaged changes
4. **Analyze changes**: Understand what files were modified and their purpose
5. **Generate commit message**: Create appropriate conventional commit message using:
   - Valid scopes: `docs`, `pages`, `stub:base`, `stub:[copy-point-name]`
   - Proper commit types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
6. **Create commit**: Use proper format with Claude Code attribution

**Note**: The pre-commit hook will automatically run tests and linting before allowing the commit to proceed. If tests fail, the commit will be blocked until issues are resolved.

**Testing Setup**: Pre-commit hooks now include comprehensive test validation to prevent broken code from entering the repository.
